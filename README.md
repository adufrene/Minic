# Todo

- Fix Benchmarks
    - TypeChecker doesn't currently allow assignment or comparison using null, fix.
    - SegFaults
- in iloc, merge branch with successor if alternate path guarantees return

## Doesn't Work

- BenchMarkishTopics -- Comparison between structure and null
- bert -- Comparison between structure and null
- biggest -- Assignment of null to structure
- binaryConvert -- Segmentation Fault
- creativeBenchMarkName -- Assignment of null to structure
- fact_sum -- Segmentation Fault
- hanoi_benchmark -- Comparison between structure and null
- killerBubbles -- Segmentation Fault
- OptimizationBenchmark -- Register Allocation Timeout
- primes -- Segmentation Fault
- stats -- Assignment of null to structure 

## Works

- Fibonacci
- GeneralFunctAndOptimize
- hailstone
- mile1
- mixed
- programBreaker
- TicTac
- uncreativeBenchmark
- wasteOfCycles
